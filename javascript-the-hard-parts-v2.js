// The Three JavaScript Principles:
// 1) Thread of Execution: JS runs code line by line
// 2) Memory: JS saves 'data' in it's memory for us to use later
// 3) Call Stack: JS keeps track of what is currently running

// When you run a function it gets added to the stack, once you hit return
// you go back one level above, the outermost level is global()

// There is an "Execution Context" created to run the code of a function
// and it has two parts: the thread of execution and the memory
